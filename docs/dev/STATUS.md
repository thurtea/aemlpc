# STATUS

**2026-09-12: dump_state width>1.** Persist now writes extra mapping
columns as `M<count>w<width>:`. Width-1 dumps stay `M<count>:`. Magic
`AMLPSTATE1` unchanged. Suite green (932, 0 fail).

**2026-09-12: save_object write-side.** Width>1 mappings no longer throw;
extra columns write as `key:v0;v1` and restore. Object, closure, and
buffer write nothing (FluffOS `save_svalue` has no case; cited
`temp/external/lpuni_fluffos_v1/fluffos-2.9-ds2.07/object.c` because
`temp/reference/fluffos-2.9-ds2.08` is not on disk). Restore of those
slots, and of older files that wrote `0`, is integer 0. `dump_state`
still throws on width>1. Suite green (931, 0 fail).

**2026-09-12: identity rename.** Residual `amlp` driver-name strings are
now `aemlpc` (boot text, default `mud_name`, `AEMLPC_MAX_ITERATIONS`,
tmp/test prefixes, instruct include paths). Targets were already
`aemlpc` / `aemlpc_tests`. Persist dump magic `AMLPSTATE1` left as the
on-disk format token. Suite green (929, 0 fail).

**2026-09-12: docs reset.** `ROADMAP.md` and `STATUS.md` rewritten from
scratch as short driver-first records. The driver is the product.
`mudlib/` is the minimum ship Library only. No world-content or Rifts
work on the roadmap. LPC stays mudlib-only; the host stays C++20.

Do not treat chat as status. Verify against these two files, `git log`,
build, and test.

Future STATUS entries stay a few lines each: the decision and what
changed, not the derivation.
